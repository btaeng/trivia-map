# Trivia Map

An interactive web app that displays a world map where users can click on countries to get AI-generated multiple-choice trivia questions.
Questions are powered by the **Google Gemini API** and grouped by category (history, geography, government/politics, economy, culture, cuisine).

---

## Requirements

* Node.js 18+
* npm or yarn
* Google Gemini API key (through `@google/genai`), get one for free [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
* Modern web browser (for Vite dev environment)

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/btaeng/trivia-map.git
   cd trivia-map
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Replace that whole section with this instead:

3. **Set your Gemini API key as a system environment variable**

   **Windows (PowerShell):**

   ```bash
   setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
   ```

   **macOS / Linux (bash or zsh):**

   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   ```

   After setting it, **restart your terminal** so the variable is loaded.

   To confirm it’s set:

   ```bash
   echo $GEMINI_API_KEY   # macOS/Linux
   $env:GEMINI_API_KEY  # Windows
   ```

   The server automatically detects the key from your system environment when it starts.

4. **Run the server**

   The backend (Express + Gemini API) runs on port **3001**:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Run the frontend**

   The Vite development server runs on port **5173**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open the app**

   In your browser, go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

3. Choose one of the four answer options in the popup.

## Notes

* **DO NOT SHOW ANYONE YOUR API KEY.**
* You can replace or update `src/assets` with any GeoJSON data set (e.g. regional maps).
* The backend and frontend must run simultaneously for trivia generation to work.
